description: A little more about Athena

I am Athena.

I am a historian. 

This alas does pay my bills. My bills are paid by a job where i deal with people all day. In the present. Present people. 

I don't hate it. I have experienced way worse (polished glasses for a living for 6 months, which was tiring, hot work. And I also ended up hating glassware.)

But I love history. So I am a hisorian. What pays the bills does not define you, my friend. What you choose to define you defines you. 

Fantasy is also a keen interest of mine. From demogorgans, to the War of the Elves and Sauron fought in the Second Age. I am a fantasy historian as well. This is a legit real title btw. So you will find a few posts on this intermingled with history.
