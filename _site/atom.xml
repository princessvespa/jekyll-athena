   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is a rather curious site. A walk along Richmond Road, often brings about visions of boutique stores and trendy cafes, but not this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carlile House looms on Richmond Road. Behemoth and grey, shattered windows, and tired facade, this is an unique space in Auckland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first spotted it, I was quite curious. I live right next door to it, so naturally I was intrigued about this rundown barbed wire surrounded giant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I dug. And this is what I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mansion was built from Edward Costley (an Auckland philanthropist) and his money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Edward Costley passed away, he bequeathed one-seventh part of his estate to the Kohimarama Training School. This was no longer in existence, so the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ trustees recommended that an institution should be established to take charge of boys and girls from the Industrial Schools of the district, when they reached the age at which they were sent out into the world to earn their own living”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plot of land was chosen on what is now Richmond Road, and The Costley Home for Boys was built in 1886. This institution was to tutor suitable boys until they were thus capable of “being left to their own control”, and for the girls to be trained to be able to perform domestic service and other 19th century appropriate womanly stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They erected the buildings at a cost of £2830, and expended a further sum of £703 in furnishing the house and improving the grounds. Under the will of the late Mrs Rebecca Hodge, a further endowment of £672 has been made for girls in charge of the institution. As each lad is apprenticed out a portion of his wages, not exceeding 9s per week, is used for his maintenance, while the balance is placed in the Savings Bank to his credit”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/images/thehouse.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 22 years, this institution provided boys and girls with the practical schooling needed for them to go out in the world and secure a position. This functionality as a youth institution is one of the reasons why it is marked as a place of such significance now, as it reflects a trend for the new zealand as a whole for the time to create such facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It continued shaping young boys and girls, until the closure in 1908.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It then went on to serve as Richmond Road Children’s Home for two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial hardship plagued the school, as witnessed by a 1910 newspaper article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, a John Logan Campbell, the “father of Auckland” promised a sum of 1000 as long as the public matches this. “So confident was Sir John Logan Campbell of the kindly sympathy of the auckland public for the children….that he paid his 1000 in advance”. The article was requesting donations from the public, to match this generosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1927, it once again closed its doors. And remained inactive until 1931 where it became a temporary shelter after the Hawke’s Bay Earthquake. From 1935 to 1969, it once again had a new name slapped on it, opening its tired door as the base for the Church Army, which on first impressions seems like a some kind of militant church movement but after researching, come up as a social movement run by the Anglican church which worked to improve slum areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The property came to its present functionality, once it was purchased by a Tongan community group in 1976-7. They went ahead and refitted the chapel to be a local church for their community, but the main body of the property has since fallen into decay and despair. And despite being listed as protected under the heritage new zealand foundation, and surrounded by barbed wire, it is often attacked by vandals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also despite there being a lot of intimidation surrounding the site from people who view themselves a personal protectors of the property. My research brought me to this gem from the  “Grey Lynn Lion” 13th LEGION”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter at your own expense, I don’t know who gave you the rights to take photos let alone enter the property. But next time you do I promise you and any who enter without consent will be the victims of the stories of those who have been physically abused for entering the gates of the Carlyle building. We are the gatekeepers of this building……“YOU”!!! will feel the what it is like to near an inch of your life and we will HURT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a little much. The lion properly has more roar than bite, but this kind of insular mindset is detrimental to this historical site. The Tongan Church next door and other such protectors stand bodyguard to the place, but they guard against shifting it to be restored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has also been deemed a fire hazard, and the Council and the church are at a standstill on this. One wishes for money, another wishes to not give that amount. This is its present, and my blogs will focus more on the past, so if you are interested in this an article can be found here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;amp;objectid=11266966&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullshit 99 percent sure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legends of death and tragedy were also constantly arising while I was researching. The tale goes that 43 boys perished in the house after a fire ripped through the house. There is no evidence of this. No newspaper articles, no facts, just a whispered tale of haunting that locals like to share around hoping to get a shiver or a gasp.&lt;/p&gt;
